Hello, thank you for your interest in my project. I have attached a copy of the iPython notebooks I made over the 4 week period, the python script used to generate the data for the particle motion experiment, the data used for the heat map experiment in csv format and in the original python file. I have also added a copy of my research report. If you have any questions, please be sure to ask me.
